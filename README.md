## Description

This repository is just to show the exposure I've had with different algorithms. I typically will demonstrate my "forced" version, aka the version I did to pass the test cases in the most direct way I can think of. 

Then I provide the refactored, more efficient way, which I find by googling methods and looking up any questions I have about the problem specifically.
